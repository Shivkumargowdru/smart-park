In this project we presented the architecture and the implementation of a smart gardening system. The system consists of two types of sensors motes (DHT11,DHT22,Capacitive and IR sensor), special soil humidity sensors, with the use of relays python application that is used for data collection. Performance evaluation showed that our system manages to maintain soil humidity levels regardless of external factors (i.e. variations at temperature and sunlight). It also proved that the system is aware of the different watering needs each.
